Regex - Onboarding Hackathon

This is the REGEX-ONBOARDING HACKATHON assignment for group 2.
This project is designed to help us learn data extraction using regular expressions in JS.

It has to do with the building of a new social media app. The app aggregates data from different sources and displays it to users in a personalized feed.
The backend engineering team has built an API that pulls in data from various sources like news outlets, social networks, blogs etc.
But the data is raw and unstructured. The task is writing scripts to extract and structure specific kinds of data from the raw API responses.

Here are some of the data types the product team needs extracted:

•	Restaurant names and cuisine types

•	Ingredient lists from recipes

•	RGB color values

•	Social media usernames

•	Product codes

•	News Headlines

•	Event dates and times

•	Email addresses

It is worth noting that Regular expressions will be our primary tool for data extraction.
